# CSS test in React Storybook

A simple Storybook setup to quickly spit out some reusable components. Each component is stylable with some helper functions and mixins (found in scss abstracts). Just the most basic stuff in here, extend as needed.

Rep components in Storybook by adding a *.stories.js file in the component's folder.

## To get running

````
npm i
npm run storybook
````
